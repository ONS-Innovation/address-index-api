<h1>ONS Address Index API Developers Guide</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) Address Index API provides public sector organisations with address lookup functions, via HTTP. It allows users to look-up addresses in England and Wales, and to select and retrieve the official address.</p>

<p>The API is currently only available to a limited audience. Access can be requested by contacting <a href="mailto:ai.users@ons.gov.uk">Address Index</a></p>

<p>API access is restricted. API keys are required, and will be provided for those granted access.</p>

<p>This API is currently in Beta and still being developed. Please be aware that as a result there may occasionally be breaking changes as we enhance functionality and respond to feedback.</p>

<h2>Getting data from ONS Address Index API</h2>

<p>The Address Index API provides a number of end points to enable address look-up.</p>

<p>Each end point and its basic purpose are available from the <a href="explore-the-api/readme.md">Explore the API readme</a>.</p>
 
<p>A <a href="ai-swagger.json">full swagger definition</a> is also provided.</p>

<h2>Address Index Simple Tester</h2>

The <a href="simple-tester/readme.md">Address Index Simple Tester</a> allows users to use the various functions available via the API, providing an input request and receiving a response from the API.
